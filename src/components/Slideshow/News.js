        Our priority has always been safety and health of our guests and it seems that it will be hard to guarantee this.<br />
        Jubilant 10th edition of Havana en Belgrado deserves everything best! And we won't settle for less!<br />Stay safe and healthy and we will get back to you soon with more info about dates for 2021.<br /><br />Your HeB Team‚ù§
